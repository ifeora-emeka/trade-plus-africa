# TradePulse Africa
- The home page of TradePulse Africa should serve as a dynamic and intuitive entry point, offering users immediate visibility into key non-oil export commodities such as cocoa, sesame seeds, and cashew nuts. At the top, a prominent search bar enables quick access to specific goods, while below, a curated section highlights the most popular and actively traded items. Each listed item on the homepage will display its current international market price for both Grade 1 and Grade 2 quality levels, accompanied by a simple visual indicator—such as an up or down arrow with color coding—to show whether prices are rising or falling based on recent trends.
- This real-time snapshot allows exporters, traders, and analysts to rapidly assess market movements and prioritize their attention. 
Upon clicking any listed commodity, users will be directed to a detailed information page that provides a comprehensive view of that item’s market performance. The top of the page will reaffirm the current prices for both quality grades, along with the latest update timestamp and the primary trading regions such as Europe, Asia, and North America. A central feature will be an interactive time-series chart that plots historical and forecasted price trends using data derived from the machine learning model described in the study, incorporating variables like seasonality, exchange rates, and global demand shifts. 
- Users can adjust the time range (e.g., 30 days, 6 months, 1 year) to analyze short- or long-term patterns, with forecasted values displayed alongside confidence intervals to indicate reliability. 
The details page will also include contextual insights explaining key factors influencing the current and projected prices, such as harvest cycles, policy changes, or supply chain disruptions, helping users understand the drivers behind market fluctuations. Additionally, a validation metric will be shown to reflect how closely recent forecasts have aligned with actual market prices, reinforcing trust in the system’s accuracy. 
- Exporters and policymakers can use this information to inform pricing strategies, negotiate contracts, and plan logistics with greater confidence, aligning with the goal of enhancing Nigeria’s competitiveness in global trade. 
To support decision-making, the platform will integrate a responsive design suitable for desktop and mobile access, ensuring usability across different stakeholder groups including field agents, export companies, and government agencies. All data will be sourced from reliable international databases such as FAOSTAT, UNCTAD, and the World Bank, combined with national trade records, to ensure consistency and relevance. By combining predictive intelligence with user-friendly visualization, TradePulse Africa will function not only as a price tracking tool but as a strategic dashboard that empowers stakeholders with timely, accurate, and actionable market intelligence.
